# friendFinder

FriendFinder application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Getting Started

Clone a copy of the liri-node-app repo by running:

`git clone git@github.com:SomatThakali/friendFinder.git`

## Installation

In order to run the test, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git.

For Windows, you have to download and _install git and Node.js_.

OS X users should install _Homebrew_. Once Homebrew is installed, _run brew install git_ to install git, and _brew install node_ to install Node.js.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:

run: `npm install`
